# Crop and yield prediction for NLR

Repository for crop and yield prediction for different grain types (Based on a [Master Thesis](https://uia.brage.unit.no/uia-xmlui/handle/11250/3070213) from University of Agder).

## Crop Prediction

The crop prediction model uses satellite images to predict which type of grain is produced on the crops

## Yield Prediction

The yield prediction model uses satellite images, farmer data, weather data, and crop prediction data (from the crop prediction model) to estimate the yield for a specific crop per farmer.

## Data

The data is gathered and preprocessed using multiple scripts developed by InFuture AS, not present in this repository.

## Note

The results obtained in this repository did not match the results reported in their thesis, however, this is most likely due to using different datasets.
